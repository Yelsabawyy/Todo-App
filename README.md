## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Expo CLI (for running the frontend)

### Installation

1. Backend Setup:

    Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

    I will upload .env file to facilitate the process so no need to create .env file

    Run the backend server:

    npm start

2. Frontend Setup:

    Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    cd todoapp
    npm install

    Run the frontend:

    npx expo start

    .env file:

    please change ip to your ip:3000
